# Reflective Report
I have not used argparse nor pandas3d in the past, I have only used git and python before. 
I can say that argparse was quick to follow because I am comfortable with using the terminal as this is where I have learned the basics of git, and I have also tinkered with Linux before.
As you may know, Linux can be used headless.
Pandas3d was a little bit more tricky for me at the beginning especially the angles that the camera is supposed to look at since I don't have any experience with that.

I want to talk about git first; I think that this tool is very powerful since it solves a lot of problems that may come up during the development of a project mainly, version control.
Learning the most basic commands for git has a massive impact on your development skills and gives you advantages that you would not be able to find in any other tools. 
Things that I have noticed whilst using git is that forces you to document every major change and addition to your project.
It forces you to write in a modular way; breaking tasks into atomic levels, meaning a method is non-dependent of other methods.
It forces you to document all features that you have implemented which is a very good thing because the project is easier to understand as a whole.
Good documentation enables potential users to easily learn the project or module.
With all that being said, git unintentionally gives a lot of development skills that will help manage project in a more organised, manageable way. 

Argparse is something I haven't come across in the past. 
I have tinkered with sys.argv in python before which certainly made using argparse so much easier since the principle is the same. 
Learning about this great tool has certainly allowed me to understand more about the command line. 
Especially with how it is possible to add arguments and work with those arguments directly to set options for your program.
It is a bit different from sys.argv because you're only getting a value from sys.argv using indices, whereas with argparse arguments you can also set default values, data type, help commands, actions, etc.
This is something I have never encountered before, and learning about it now definitely gives me another tool I can work with for future projects.

I also have not used pandas3d before. In fact, I have not used anything that deals with 3d graphics in the past.
This did not affect me that much when doing the project because pandas3d has good documentation on their website, and if you can read documentation, you can do just about anything.
I have surely learned many things that are pandas3d specific.
For example, I learned how you can set the position of the camera and also the angle that you want it to look at. 
All of these will make using the library easier in the future since I will know where to start.
