# Reflective Report
I have not used argparse nor pandas3d in the past, I have only used git and python before. 
I can say that argparse was quick to follow because I am comfortable with using the terminal as this is where I have learned the basics of git, and I have also tinkered with linux server before.
Pandas3d was a little bit more tricky for me at the beginning especially the angles that the camera is supposed to look at since I don't have any experience with that.

I want to talk about git first; I think that this tool is very powerful since it solves a lot of problem that may come up during the development of a project mainly, version control.
