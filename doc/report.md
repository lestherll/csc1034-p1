# Reflective Report
I have used some form of all these tools before; not necessarily the ones that we used in this project. 

I have used an IDE before but not to the point where I used most features. 
I always found that I only needed the editor and the compiler/interpreter which is why I always resorted to using lightweight editors such as Visual Studio Code.
I also prefer working with the terminal as opposed to GUI based actions because I am more efficient at typing.
However, I cannot deny the benefits that an IDE, a tool with tools within it, offers.
Learning about IDEs will definitely help me be more efficient with project development. 

I have also used Markdown before. 
It is a simple tool that gets the job done. 
Generally, that is what we want when we only need to get the information across. 
We do not need fancy features like what a fancy word processor such as Microsoft Word would have. 
I also like how you can do it pretty much on any editor and without that knowledge of HTML tags or CSS. 
And because of the benefits mentioned; this tool will help me become more productive.

Version control is very powerful since it solves a lot of problems that come up often during development. 
Learning the most basic commands for git has a massive impact on your development skills and gives you advantages that you would not be able to find in any other tools. 
Things that I have noticed whilst using git is that it somehow forces you to document every major change and addition to your project. 
It forces you to write in a modular way; breaking tasks into atomic levels, meaning a method is non-dependent of other methods. 
It forces you to document all features that you have implemented which is a very good thing because the project is easier to understand. 
Good documentation enables potential users to easily learn the module. 
Git indirectly provides a lot of development skills that will help manage projects in a more organised, manageable way in the future. 

Dependency management and sandboxing are also good tools that help with development. 
Pip allows me to manage dependencies of my project and venv allows me to work in a separate environment so that when something goes wrong, it will not affect my whole system. 
I have also used a tool before called VirtualBox which is a form of sandboxing tool except it is not exclusively for programming. 
The principle is the same with venv, separation of working environments. 
Learning more about these tools will help me organise my projects more easily.  

Reading the manual is a very crucial part of development because the manual tells you how to use a tool. 
If the manual and project are written very well, I do not even have to know how the whole project works and I can just use parts of the module that I need and refer to the manual.
